As with states in the US, each emirate has some degree of independence, but there&#8217;s also a federal government. This is known as the Supreme Council of Rulers and is made up of the seven emirs &#8211; the leaders of each emirate &#8211; who inherit their positions.</p><p>Since the 1950s, when oil was discovered in the region, the UAE&#8217;s economy has undergone rapid change. As well as oil and gas exportation, the country has focused on growing its construction and tourism industries; to an extent, these go hand in hand &#8211; the impressive feats of modern design on display in Dubai are among the main attractions for visitors.</p>
